# Chaos-Aided Quantization Index Modulation
# Abstract
By leverageing chaos theory, we introduce the Chaos-QIM (Quantization Index Modulation) technique. Initially, a chaotic system generates a random sequence, which is then transformed into a uniform distribution using modulo lattice operation. Chaos-QIM utilizes this uniform sequence as dither in the quantization process, ensuring the resulting stego-signal is statistically indistinguishable from the original signal. The paper rigorously proves both the statistical indistinguishability of the stego-signal and the system’s resistance to attack. A comprehensive security analysis highlights Chaos-QIM’s resistance against statistical steganalysis techniques.
